This program codes the algorithm described in Haigh 1978 for calculating the
rate of Muller's Ratchet in asexual populations.  In a nutshell, the Ratchet, 
first suggested in Muller ?, is a process by which asexual populations 
suffer higher mutational loads than sexual populations.  The mechanism is that, 
in any population, the "least-loaded class" -- the set of organisms with the 
fewest mutations -- may go extinct in a given generation by chance.  Sexual 
populations can regenerate such a least-loaded class through sexual
recombination.  Asexuals cannot; each time a least-loaded class is lost, the 
ratchet clicks forward, and the asexuals are weaker.  

The speed of the ratchet is dependent on the size of the population, the 
rate of mutation, and the selection coefficient of the mutations.  This version of
the program is intended for evolutionary biologists learning Ruby, so the 
task of iterating over many values of N, U, and s is left as an exercise for the
student.



# The following notes are useful for translating from Haigh 1978 to the Perl code.  

# p_k(t+1) = Sum from j = 0 to k of X_k-j(t) * (1-s)**(k-j) * [e**-U * U**j / j!] / T_1(t) 

# e**-U * U**j / j! = e**-U * the product from i = 0 to j of U/j.
#this is read out of a vector @mut_probs created by "generate_mut_probs"
# such that $mut_probs[j] == e**-U * U**j /j!

# (1-s)**h = Product from i = 0 to h of (1-s)
#this is read out of a vector @fitnesses created by "generate_fitnesses"
#such that $fitnesses[h] == (1-s)**h

# T_n(t) = Sum from i = 0 to inf. of X_i(t) * (1-s)**(i*r)
# T_1(t) = Sum from i = 0 to inf. of X_i(t) * (1-s)**i
#this is generated through the "find_T" function, that iterates over $classes[i]*$fitness[$i]
# remember T_1(t) = N * W_bar(t) (size of population * population mean fitness)

"A simple generator for random numbers taken from a Poisson distribution 
is obtained using this simple recipe: if x1, x2, ... is a sequence of random 
numbers with uniform distribution between zero and one, 
k is the first integer for which the product x1 路 x2 路 ... 路 xk+1 < e-位"
